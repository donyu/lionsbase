A website to learn more about the rising startup community at Columbia University.

## Technology Stack

### Frontend

* Bootstrap - for its features, grid systems, and responsive design elements
* SASS - so I can make the website pretty w/ less work than CSS
* HAML - because it's just less text I need to write
* Coffeescript - because it beats straight javascript
* Formtastic - since I predict there will be a lot of forms in this app
* CarrierWave - so entrepreneurs can upload any relevant startup files
* Backbone.js - MVC everywhere, but actually will help w/ front-end
* Mustache - for those templates that backbone views will use

### Backend

* Ruby on Rails - because it's easiest for me
* RSpec - for testing
* Postgres - well it's better than MySQL
* Heroku - is there even a better way to deploy rails apps?

### APIs

* Mandrill - offers highest # of free email sends
* Twitter/Facebook - kind of have to nowadays
* Google Analytics - data driven development is a popular buzz word these days
